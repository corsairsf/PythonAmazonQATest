# Test Cases are stored here

# -*- coding: utf8 -*-
# we should add test cases here because we can miss some cases while writing automation code or
# some manuel testers (test analystes) can handle this more efficiently 
# we can obtain test cases from test management tools, I used this for my previous project: http://www.inflectra.com/SpiraTest/Integrations/Unit-Test-Frameworks.aspx
# We can also record the result of test cases to test management tool

# for maintainability, we can seperate web test cases by page name but I just listed every case in same array
